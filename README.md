# TFTSimulation
A script to simulate the rerolls of the shop of the game TFT

RIght now it's only a simulation about "Assuming nobody has bought anything, how many times do you need to reroll to obtain a particular character (of tier T) X times, if you're of level Y?"
The .csv are the basic data of the game of probabilities of each character appearing in the shop and how many characters are by tier. The .ods is the result of this simulation for 1, 3 and 9
characters for each possibility of level/tier. The number of simulations done were 10000 in the first pair, and 1000 for the third one (as 9 characters are more hard to find, more rerolls
  were needed and the script takes longer to execute, that's why there are less matches there).
